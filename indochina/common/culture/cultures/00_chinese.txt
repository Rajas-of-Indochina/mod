# Burmese Myinsi
# # Cavalry
# # While not as pronounced as in Europe and other similar cultures, mounted warriors hold an elite position in Burmese society, "because horses and elephants are worthy of kings; they are excellent things, of power."[5]
# #
# # The Myinsi (မြင်းစီး lit. Horse rider or Cavalier) served as a knightly class of sorts being the only class of people allowed mobility throughout the kingdom without permission and ranking only below the noble-ministers. The one of the highest military rank is termed myinhmu mintha (literally cavalry prince) or perhaps better translates as knight commander in English.[5]
# #
# # From the 17th century onward, cavalry troops made up about 10% of a typical regiment. The men of the cavalry were drawn mainly from hereditary villages in Upper Burma. One of the core areas that provided expert horsemen since the early 14th century was Sagaing. The Sagaing Htaungthin (စစ်ကိုင်း ထောင်သင်း [zəɡáɪɴ tʰàʊɴ ɵɪ́ɴ]; lit. "Thousand-strong Regiment of Sagaing") cavalry regiment, founded in 1318 by King Saw Yun of Sagaing, was maintained up till the fall of Burmese monarchy. The formation of the regiment consisted of nine squadrons, from each named after the hereditary village.[10]

# Adaptive Traditions⁴
# Hakka Walled Village⁵
# Tulou Archer⁶
# Skirmisher
# Hakka⁶⁽¹⁾

# ### 4. Hakka Migrations after the Qin dynasty brought this N. Chinese group to settle in some of the most southernly regions. This should give (1) ignore negative culture opinion, (2) adaptive traditions, (3) get some increased movement speed in the jungle terrain of S. China.
# ### 5. You gotta google this. Essentially, the Hakka get discriminated against and persecuted so often in China, they've developed a unique village style (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_walled_village).
# ### 6. A Hakka Tolou refers to their highly bottlenecked point-defense platforms at the singular village entrance. Very cool ngl.
# ### 6.(1). I know Hakka ppl are a subgroup of Han, but if you read up on the persecution they have faced historically, it sure looks like other Han ppl don't consider them to be "civilized", and the Cantonese persecution of them was so intense that the developed their "walled village" platforms. This speaks to a numerous, self-sustaining culture that defended itself from external threats

# Cantonese

# Canton Junk⁹
# Pearl River Domination¹¹

# 9. Canton Junk/Yue Rivermen refers to the exploitation of the Pearl River Delta by these two groups of people. The Baiyue (or 100 Yue) were a tribal, polynesian-style-tattoo having people conquered by the Qin. For gamification purposes only, I've split the Yue into three groups. The Canton and Wuyue groups have setteled in and around the Pearl river intensely, and are now a cosmopolitan trade people who are in strong contact with the Chinese.
# 11. The canton people came to dominate the pearl river via the city of Canton at this time. In 758, it was the most important port in the east. It's sacking in that year by Persian and Arab raiders lead to a decline in importance, and so around our start date, the city should be in meh shape, but it is the focus of canton culture. I reccomend a few broken buildings in the city that can be fixed, and the "Pearl River Domination" should give them (1) increased naval speed, (2) zero embarkation cost, (3) +2 trade value to any silk road modded trade outpost in their land. Idk if the balance is anywhere near right on this, but these are more just suggestions.

# Mien
# Hmong
# Old Traditions¹³

# 13. Extreme country culture conversion resistance. Don't make them spread out ALL over SE China like the TangMod does, as their range is rather limited outside of a large number of exclaves. However, I don't think I need to explain why their county culture conversion resistance bonus would need to be huge. These are basically the only non-Sinic peoples to thrive in China in large numbers to this day. Their shared ancestors with the Mon-Khymer people (according to wikipedia) show that they are a deeply non-Sinic people, who have regardless lived in parts of what is considered to be the core of China even. I refer you to this file for the modern distribution of the people (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong%E2%80%93Mien_languages#/media/File:Hmong-Mien-en.svg). We can infer that while they may have had a single connected large culture blob at some point, a massive amount of them still remain and live in their own non-Sinic ways.
#
#

# Gan

# Gan Exclaves¹
# Gan Rivermen⁸ - Lüè hé zhě⁸

# 1. The Gan-people lived almost exclusively in little exclaves in their isloated province of Jiangxi. This should give some culture conversion resistance.
# 8. The Gan people are a unique group living around the Gan river. This land was sparsely populated (and even then, the main settlements were Yue people cities), before the Qin emperor began large scale colonization of the area. The "Gan Rivermen" innovation should allow Gan rulers to raid over rivers, if their government type allows them to raid.
#

# Hlai

# Malarial Immunity¹⁴
# Heinan Jungles
# Hlai Jungle Warrior¹⁵

# 14. Relative immunity to malaria has kept the Hlai people secure on their little island for pretty much all of history. The Han themselves complain about this EVERY time they invaded lol. Game wise this should give them a +20 combat bonus when defending lands of their own culture. Idk tho, what if the culture spreads or something?
# 15. The martial prowess of the Hlai is well documented. Both in recent times, as allies of the PRC and staunch defenders against Japanese imperialism, and in ancient times against the Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. Fr these ppl have fought almost every dynasty lol.
