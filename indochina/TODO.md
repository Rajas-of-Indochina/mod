- Useful Liege/Vassal Alliances https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2229456694

- Game mode disabling primogeniture
- Form faction against primogeniture

- Factions based on:

    - Court: Each member is interested above all in improving their position in the realm, though council positions, new titles and ensuring they have to contribute as little as possible to their liege be it men or gold.
    - Prosperity: Seeking to improve their personal finances rather than prestige, these vassals would prefer peace though they are not opposed to war as long as taxes are kept low.
    - Glory: War gives everyone an opportunity for Glory, as long as you win of course. So long as you keep providing the realm with regular victories and prestige these vassals will happily support you.

    Court
        Greed
        Treacherous
        Evil
        Vengeful
        Spineless
    Prosperity
        Rationality
        Honor
        Compassionate
        Content
        Godless
    Glory
        Magnanimous
        Bold
        Insane
        Zealous

    Above a certain discontent a faction will begin to support claimants. If no claimants are available they will demand lowered crown authority.

    - Some claimant factions should always be shown
    - Faith/Culture factions
        Will be happy if someone of their faith/culture is appointed to council, or granted a title
        Will be angered if someone of their faith/culture is fired from council, or title revoked, or executed
        Goes double if they are a powerful vassal
        May be joined by counties as well, and opinion will shift accordingly
        Will demand independence when provoked

    Each discontent faction increases your stress gain
    50-70% is discontent
    70%+ they will begin to make demands. If demands are not met discontent goes up
    If it reaches 100% they make an ultimatum
