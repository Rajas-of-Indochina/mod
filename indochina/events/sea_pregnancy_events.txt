#Events for pregnancy on actions

namespace = pregnancy

# This event is always called on pregnancy start. Determines if the pregnancy will continue smoothly, if it will continue with complications, or be terminated prematurely.
#If either the birth goes smoothly, the mother grows sick, or the child grows sick, it will trigger the ordinary birth event (birth.0001). Otherwise a custom event will be triggered.
