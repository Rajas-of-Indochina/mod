  game_concept_nomadic_holding:0 "Nomadic"
  game_concept_nomadic_holding_desc:0 "Nomads have two types of [holdings|E] - Camps and Pastures. The Camp is the capital of the nomadic tribe, and they may only have one. The rest of their holdings are Pastures.\n\nThe Camp provides a moderate amount of [tax|E] and [levies|E] while Pastures provide much less. The amount given depends on [terrain|E], with steppe and grasslands providing the most.\n\nWhile lacking in upgrades, nomads may send horses to graze in a [holding|E], providing a much greater amount of [tax|E] and [levies|E]. However this amount will decrease every year as the grasses are used up. After four years, the Grazing Area is expended, and provides no more resources. It will then be left to recover over the course of 20 years. Once this time has passed, the Grazing Area may be used again."
