 alevi.0003.desc:0 "As Turkic hordes conquered and settled in new lands, they brought Islam with them, spreading their beliefs and practices across vast territories. After Islamisation, those migratory tribes did not simply abandon their old way of life, but merged it with a new set of beliefs, with Turko-Islamic preachers seemingly preaching a slightly different form of Islam with unique beliefs. These days, one sage among them stands out - Haji Bektash Veli. This charismatic wandering mystic has systemised these beliefs and already garnered many followers over the years, word has it that many previously non-Muslim Turks are converting to Islam in flocks. He himself claims to preach nothing new, and states again and again that he is drawing his teachings from past Turkic Muslim scholars like Hoja Ahmad Yasawi in Kazakhstan, though some argue his words sometimes contradict orthodox Islam."
