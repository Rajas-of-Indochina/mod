 circassian_decision_conversion_return_desc:0 "Ridiculous! We [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] have been calling our gods by foreign names from foreign nations. Naturally, such nonsense cannot continue! We will return calling our gods by their original [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] names!"

 circassian_decision_1_desc:0 "When the foreigners first told us of a god called Jesus, we understood that there lies some wisdom in their words. But nowadays, they come and try to tell us what to do, that there is only one God and nature is not to be worshipped... Do they think we will shame our ancestors this easily? Everyone knows that Jesus and the Holy Mother are revered as the heads of a pantheon consisting of thousands of deities."

 circassian_decision_thamade_desc:0 "Ancient custom among Northern Caucasians dictates that there must always be wise elders to guide the people. These elders, whom we call $trait_thamade$s, are individuals who have led decent lives and reached a certain age, and their wisdom is highly respected: one word from their mouths can end entire wars. It seems that now, people are looking to me to fulfill this role. It is a great honor, and I believe it's time for me to accept this responsibility and fulfill my duties for the betterment of the community."

 circassian_decision_seven_desc:0 "The legends are clear that we Ubykhs have ancient common roots with Circassians and Abkhazians. This is supported by the fact that we speak languages that are related.  Thus, we saw no problem in intermixing with them, just as they saw no problem doing the same. Over time, we have become so intertwined with the Circassians that many of us now speak Circassian fluently and even identify as Circassians, and outsiders can't really the difference between us. It could be beneficial to strengthen our bond with the Circassian community by fully embracing the identity for ourselves."

 circassian_decision_eight_desc:0 "While we identify as Christians and hold reverence for Jesus, outsiders are often surprised to witness our worship of other deities and engagement in ancient rituals. Clergymen from Constantinople and Rome frequently label our beliefs as heretical. While their criticism of our wisdom is laughable, it's undeniable that followers of Rome and Constantinople wield considerable power and could offer us valuable alliances. Perhaps it's worth considering abandoning our old traditions and fully embracing what is perceived as "true" Christianity."

 circassian_decision_nine_desc:0 "Lately, there has been growing interaction between our people and the Armenians, or the Jərməlı as we call them, who hail from a country in the south. Their merchants persist in frequenting our territories for trade. Moreover, there have been some cases where Armenians, fleeing feuds or other disturbances, sought sanctuary in our lands, forming small communities of skilled artisans. There is much we disagree on, but we can agree that we all love money. Perhaps we should enhance our collaboration by formally inviting more Armenians to settle in our territories, fostering mutual prosperity."

 circassian_decision_unify_desc:0 "Circassians are organized into a strict tribal structure, with every individual being a member of a family, clan, and tribe. They are also short-tempered, however: two people bumping into each other can trigger a feud between the two families, which could then trigger a conflict between two tribes that may last decades if not centuries. And so Circassians have been fighting each other endlessly for as long as they have existed; only bonding together when they have a common enemy. The medieval historian Al-Masudi famously said that the Circassians could conquer the world if only they had a king to unite them. Not like anyone could ever accomplish that..."

 circassian_decision_kabardia_desc:0 "The Alans, once known worldwide as great conquerors, are a relic of the past now. The last Alan enclave had survived in the Caucasus for centuries, but they have recently been in decline, with a significant population of their people moving into the mountains or lands far away, abandoning their cities. As a final blow, their lands have now fallen in our hands. The land left by them is perfectly ready to be settled by our loyal subjects. The Circassian tribe living North of the Kuban, the Kabardians, have no doubt the worst land out of all Circassians, nothing but harsh and infertile soil, with looming threat of nomadic raids. If we offer some petty noble titles, or tax exemptions thay can't refuse, the entire tribe will want to migrate to these lands, which were once settled by our distant ancestors - why not now?."

 avar_decision_sassanid_desc:0 "While we are proud Avars, it is known among family and friends that our lineage originally descends from Iranians of old. Some claimed that our great ancestor Khosro descended from minor governors appointed to the region by the Sassanid Empire. Other more educated men, albeit a minority, have suggested that he himself may have been of Sassanid blood - based on old legends and folk geneologies linking him to Emperor Bahram Gur. There is no reason why this minority opinion shouldn't become more prevalent, given enough evidence is "discovered" by some wise men who would certainly accept a donation from us to help conduct their noble work..."

But now it is clear we are not leaving any time soon. Over time, we have become like them in many ways, but we still keep our essence. The Abaza clans have gathered, and we have expanded; O [Glossary( 'Narts', 'NARTS_GLOSS' )], hear our voice! It is time to proclaim the great Abazashta!"
