 circassian_decision_seven_desc:0 "The Ubykhs, Circassians, and Abkhazians have ancient common roots and speak languages that are related yet distinct. Circassians identify as "Adyghe," while the Ubykhs use "Tuakhe," two terms that may share a connection. Over time, the Ubykhs have become so intertwined with the Circassians that many Ubykhs now speak Circassian fluently and even identify as Circassians. It could be beneficial to strengthen our bond with the Circassian community by fully embracing the identity "Adyghe" for ourselves."
