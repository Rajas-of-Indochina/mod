 circassian_decision_conversion_return_desc:0 "Ridiculous! We [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] have been calling our gods by foreign names from foreign nations. Naturally, such nonsense cannot continue! We will return calling our gods by their original [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] names!"

 circassian_decision_1_desc:0 "When the foreigners first told us of a god called Jesus, we understood that there lies some wisdom in their words. But nowadays, they come and try to tell us what to do, that there is only one God and nature is not to be worshipped... Do they think we will shame our ancestors this easily? Everyone knows that Jesus and the Holy Mother are revered as the heads of a pantheon consisting of thousands of deities."

 circassian_decision_thamade_desc:0 "Ancient custom among Northern Caucasians dictates that there must always be wise elders to guide the people. These elders, whom we call $trait_thamade$s, are individuals who have led decent lives and reached a certain age, and their wisdom is highly respected: one word from their mouths can end entire wars. It seems that now, people are looking to me to fulfill this role. It is a great honor, and I believe it's time for me to accept this responsibility and fulfill my duties for the betterment of the community."

 circassian_decision_seven_desc:0 "The legends are clear that we Ubykhs have ancient common roots with Circassians and Abkhazians. This is supported by the fact that we speak languages that are related.  Thus, we saw no problem in intermixing with them, just as they saw no problem doing the same. Over time, we have become so intertwined with the Circassians that many of us now speak Circassian fluently and even identify as Circassians, and outsiders can't really the difference between us. It could be beneficial to strengthen our bond with the Circassian community by fully embracing the identity for ourselves."

 circassian_decision_zeikwebze_desc:0 "Zeik’webze is a Circassian military code that has been utilised by many legendary warriors in the past, and it has played a large role in the outcome of many wars. In Zeik’webze, regular Circassian sentences are encrypted by reordering words, changing phonemes, removing certain letters and adding meaningless suffixes and prefixes. This is not done randomly, but based on a code that only a few people know, and if it is discovered, the code is modified. Thus, enemy armies and spies, even if they speak Circassian as their native tongue, would have no way of understanding our intentions. Though very difficult, If I regularly practice this code with my soldiers, we may be able to utilise it in battle."

 circassian_decision_chakobsa_desc:0 "Schak’webze or Chakobsa is a secret Circassian language invented by hunters and spoken by very few people. The grammar is basically Circassian, but the vocabulary seeks to emulate the original language by imitating sounds of nature. It is an ancient hunters' tradition to use Schak’webze during a hunt. Now that I go hunting, I should probably learn Schak’webze."

 circassian_decision_werqibze_desc:0 "Werqibze is the name some give to the secret Circassian dialect spoken by only the best of nobles. It is proper speech, elegant and elite, unlike the common vulgar tongue. Not everyone is allowed to learn Werqibze, but only the most well-behawed of nobles. Giving a speech in this language is probably one of the greatest honours for a person."
