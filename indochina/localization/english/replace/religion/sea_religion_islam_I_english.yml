 alevi_desc:0 "Alevism is a heterodox branch of Islam that integrates elements of Tengrist beliefs. Alevis view the Qur'an as too holy to be understood and taken literally, and instead, look at the teachings of Twelve Imams and Turkic spiritual leaders, as documented in the Buyruk scriptures. In Alevi belief, Allah, also known as Tengri, is El-Hakk, or "The Truth", and since Prophet Muhammad and Imam Ali are manifestations of the truth, they are the only ones to know the true meaning of the Qur'an."
