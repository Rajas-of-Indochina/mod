The main difference between the two is the organization. The Ainu faith centers on each tribe's chieftain instead of a divine descended Emperor. Ainu views the world as a spherical ocean on which many islands float. This belief is based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. They believe the world rests on the back of a large fish, which, when it moves, causes earthquakes."

It is a spectrum, with beliefs held by individuals ranging from very close to Orthodox Twelver Shi'ism to unique and heterodox. Many Alevis view the Qur'an as too holy to be taken literally, and instead, look at the teachings of Twelve Imams and Turkic spiritual leaders, as documented in the Buyruk scriptures. In Alevi belief, Allah, also known as Tengri, is El-Hakk, or "The Truth", and since Prophet Muhammad and Imam Ali are manifestations of the truth, they are the only ones to know the true meaning of the Qur'an."

 #Muminun
 muhammad_succession_muminun_doctrine:0 "Mu'minun"
 muhammad_succession_muminun_doctrine_desc:0 "Sunni + Shia = Sushi <3 (placeholder)"

# Sunni
 muhammad_succession_sunni_doctrine_desc:0 "The best canditate to lead the believers should be the leader, regardless of if they are a descendant of the prophet or not. Abu Bakr was chosen by the Ummah as their rightful leader, thus he was the first caliph, the political leader of Islam. Religious authority should be derived from people of exceptional learning who study the Qur'an and Sunnah and pass on their teachings, forming the basis for various Sunni schools of thought."

# Shia
 muhammad_succession_shia_doctrine_desc:0 "The prophet would have wanted Imam Ali to be the leader of the Ummah, and only through him can the lineage of leadership be traced! Thus, the political leader of the Muslims should descend from the prophet by his daughter Fatima, Imam Ali's wife. Religious authority should also be derived from the Imams and their students, who, being descendants of the prophet, are the obvious canditates for spiritual guidance."

 # Zandaqa 
 muhammad_succession_zandaqa_doctrine_name:0 "Zandaqa"
 muhammad_succession_zandaqa_doctrine_desc:0 "Whether they agree with us on who the rightful successor to the prophet was or not, other Muslim sects unite on deeming us to be "Zandaqa" - heretics. This is because they foolishly claim that our beliefs are exaggerations or perversions of the faith. It does not matter what they say, we know the truth!" 

# Muhakkima
 muhammad_succession_muhakkima_doctrine_name:0 "Muhakkima"
 muhammad_succession_muhakkima_doctrine_desc:0 "Ali was Muhammad's rightful successor, but his acceptance of arbitration during the First Fitna goes against the will of Allah! Only He can judge a suitable leader for us. We don't care if all those so-called Muslims call us Kharijites - we will keep fighting for the truth!"

## Maturidi

 maturidi_desc:0 "One of the three branches of Orthodox Sunni Islam alongside Ash'arism and Atharism, Maturidism argues that ethics have an objective existence that can be derived from human reasoning, and God commands what is ethical because it is ethical. Maturidis, just like Ash'aris, assert that while the Qur'an and Sunnah are essential, human reason plays a crucial role in interpreting them and grasping the nature of God."

## Ashari

 ashari_desc:0 "Ash'arism, being one of the three branches of Orthodox Sunni Islam alongside Maturidism and Atharism, argues that ethics are derived from God's commands, thus what God commands is ethical because God commanded it. Ash'aris, like Maturidis, recognize the importance of reason in interpreting the Qur'an and Sunnah. They also agree with Maturidis on the importance of interpretation when trying to understand God's attributes."

## Quranist
 quranist_desc:0 "An Islamic movement that rejects the hadith and scholarly opinions, accepting only the base text of the Qur'an as a source, arguing that anyone can interpret the Qur'an on their own. Quranism is not an organized sect with a set group of doctrines, and includes a spectrum of beliefs."

## Mu'tazila
 mutazila_desc:0 "A school of theology that despite being nominally Sunni, disagrees with many Orthodox Sunni concepts. The Mu'tazila famously championed the concept of the "created Qur'an" and asserted that the Quran is not eternally co-existing with God, a big claim which had broader theological implications and starked heated debate."

 muwalladi_adj:0 "Muladi"
 muwalladi_adherent:0 "Muladi"
 muwalladi_adherent_plural:0 "Muladis"
 muwalladi_desc:1 "Though Ash'aris or Atharis in theology, Iberian Muslims adapted to the realities of living in a region far from the center of the Muslim world and interacting with Christian and Jewish communities. Both ethnic Arab/Berbers, also known as Moors; and Iberian converts, also known as Muladi, have developed unique traditions not found in other parts of the Muslim world."

## Imami
 imami:0 "Twelver Shi'ism"
 imami_adj:0 "Twelver"
 imami_adherent:0 "Twelver"
 imami_adherent_plural:0 "Twelvers"
 imami_desc:0 "The Twelver Shi'ites, also known as Imamis, believe that Twelve Imams fully committed to the responsibility of preserving Islam and are free from worldly desires were prophesied to lead the Ummah. They have a list of Imams they recognize, and hold that the twelfth Imam will one day return to lead Muslims into the Day of Judgement."

 #Ismaili
 ismaili_desc:0 "A Shia faith that considers the line of true Imams — those imbued with divine knowledge and infallibility — to run through Isma'il bin Jafar. They are also known as Seveners, as Isma'il was the seventh Imam after Muhammad. For Isma'ilis, under the apparent outward meaning, all things have a hidden esoteric meaning, including the Quran. In addition, due to their hidden mening, some words and numbers have special properties."

 #Qarmatians
 qarmatian_desc:0 "An esoteric sect that emerged as a radical offshoot of Isma'ilism, the Qarmatians incorporated elements of Zoroastrianism and rejected many orthodox Islamic practices, including the Hajj. Their interpretation of Islam focused heavily on the esoteric secret meanings of the Qur'an, rather than the apparent outward meanings. They held that The number of Imams was preordained by God to be seven, and there could therefore be no more Imams before the seventh Imam — Muhammad ibn Isma'il — returned to guide the faithful."

 #Nizari
 nizari:0 "Nizari Isma'ilism"
 nizari_desc:0 "A rationalist branch of Isma'ilism, Nizarism emerged after a schism over the rightful successor to the Fatimid Caliphate. The Nizaris followed Nizar ibn al-Mustansir, believing him to be the legitimate Imam. Known for their hierarchical structure and secretive practices, the Nizaris emphasized the esoteric interpretation of Islam and absolute loyalty to their Imam."

 #Zayidi
 zayidi_desc:0 "Though classified as Shia due to their acceptance of Ali over Abu Bakr, the Zayidis do not care for such labels. They believe that a true Imam is not infallible, but defined by their struggle against corruption and evil. Zayidis are therefore defined by their belief that Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the Imamate, due to his rebellion against the Umayyads. A rationalist group, Zaydis place importance on the use of logic when interpreting the Qur'an and Sunnah. Zaydism is often described as a Shia sect with Sunni tendencies due to its recognition of certain Sunni concepts and emphasis on the unity of the Muslim community."

# Alawite

 alawite:0 "Nusayri Alawism"
 alawite_desc:0 "Nusayri-Alawite religious teachings are secretive, as their practices and doctrines are often kept secret from outsiders. The Quran is only one of their sacred texts and they don't self-identify as Muslims. Alawis believe in reincarnation, and that all beings were stars cast out of heaven who must now re-earn their place by living successive good and faithful lives. God is an indivisible trinity of three parts and this trinity has had seven re-incarnations on earth, the last one being Ali, Muhammad, and Salman al-Farisi. In order to be believer, one must confesses: There is no God but Ali."

# Druze
 druze_desc:0 "Hailing from the Mountain of Druze, the Druze faith follows many of the principles of Isma'ilism, but also includes gnostic beliefs in an esoteric theology focused on the Truth of existence.Druze theology emphasizes the unity and transcendence of God and the importance of the human soul's journey toward divine truth. They reject proselytism and are known for their secrecy, with religious teachings available only to an initiated elite."

# Ibadi
 ibadi_desc:0 "The Ibadi do not believe that it is necessary for the entirety of Islam to be governed by a Caliph or an Imam, if there is no suitable candidate. They are therefore Muhakkima, recognizing neither the line of Ali or the successors of Abu Bakr as worthy leaders. Ibadis reject blind following and stress the importane of reasoning in religious matters."

# Azariqa
 azariqa_desc:0 "The Azariqas were the most radical of the Kharijite sects. Recognizing no worthy successor to Muhammad, they considered it their right and duty to fight against any leader who does not uphold their interpretation. Indeed, having any difference in interpretation would mark one as an infidel, and the killing of infidels is a duty upon all faithful who strive for justice, those who neglect this duty are also infidels. There is no such thing as a sinning Muslim, as sinning makes one an infidel. Lands inhabited by infidels are lands of war, where all acts are allowed. Christians and Jews are not among those infidels who should be killed for their disbelief, as unlike sinful "Muslims", they have not abandoned their faith."

 #Najdat
 najdat_desc:0 "Adherents of the Najdati branch of the Kharijites firmly believe in the establishment of Muslim leadership through the consensus of the faithful. The leader is not infallible, but through the community they are chosen by God. Sins can be forgiven and do not make one a disbeliever."
 
 #Sufri
 sufri_desc:0 "The Sufri believe in divine guidance and leadership through the interpretation of the word of God, rather than inheritance. The will of God becomes known as an expression of the Ummah's will, as long as the people of the Ummah are well-versed in the Quran. Shedding unnecessary blood should be avoided."
