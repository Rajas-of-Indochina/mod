  game_concept_tributary_desc:0 "A Tributary is a nominally independent [ruler|E], who pays tribute to a more powerful ruler - their [suzerain|E].\n\nThe [suzerain|E] is obligated to protect their tributary in times of war. In exchange, they receive yearly tribute in the form of gold.\n\nA Tributary may choose to pay a large amount of prestige instead of tribute, or they can simply refuse. However, this will anger the Suzerain, and they may declare war as punishment."
  game_concept_suzerain_desc:0 "A Suzerain is a ruler who controls at least one [tributary|E]. Tributaries pay their Suzerain a yearly tribute in the form of gold.\n\nIn exchange, the Suzerain must protect their tributary in times of war. If they refuse, the tributary relationship will break. \n\nA Suzerain may cancel the Tributary at any time. However, this will create a truce between them."
