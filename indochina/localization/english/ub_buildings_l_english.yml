Furs were obtained from the Sami, Finns, and people in northwestern Russia as well as from local trappers. Reindeer antler was an important item in exchange alongside walrus teeth, amber, and honey.

While the Gardens are traditionally thought to be located at Babylon, it is unclear whether the Hanging Gardens were an actual construction or a poetic creation, owing to the lack of documentation in contemporaneous Babylonian sources. A modern hypothesis has proposed that the 'Hanging Gardens of Babylon' were actually the well-documented gardens constructed by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (reigned 704 – 681 BC) for his palace at Nineveh, but over the centuries the two sites were confused. King Sennacherib's garden was well-known not just for its beauty – a year-round oasis of lush green in a dusty summer landscape – but also for the marvelous feats of water engineering that maintained the garden. The canals stretched over 50 km, cut through the mountains, to provide water to his gardens. Fruit tree orchards were planted. Also mentioned were pines, cypresses and junipers; almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes.#!"

These buildings, which belonged to the Duke of Brabant, allowed the wares to be showcased even in bad weather, but also allowed the Dukes to keep track of the storage and sale of goods, in order to collect taxes. Other buildings, made of wood or stone, enclosed the Grand Place. Brussels' Town Hall was built on the south side of the Grand Place in stages, between 1401 and 1455, and made it the seat of municipal power.

Much of the Sich was originally made from wood but as it was surrounded by a small moat with archers constantly watching guard the Sich never caught fire. During the 13th century many of the fixtures were petrified, making it nearly impossible to burn the Sich down.

This led many Lithuanian rulers to believe that the Klaipėda castle was within their grasp, oftentimes causing small skirmishes at the castle during the 15th century.

After this proclamation the Rurikid dynasty would try to take the city multiple times and fail each time, this prompted the Danes to fund the construction of a new large stone stronghold. It was initially meant to be a small, 40 meter castellum-like building but rapidly grew larger as the palisade walls crumbled and were dismantled. At the beginning of the 14th century two forecourts were established as Narva had no city walls, further cementing the importance of the Hermann castle (now fortress) to the point of reliance. The Russians, unhappy with their past pushes into Estonia, created a new fortress known as Ivangorod castle on the opposite side of the Narva river to stunt the importance of Hermann castle in 1492. In response to this the Livonian order created some quickly constructed walls to surround the city of Narva. Towards the end of the Livonian order the castle was heavily modernized with foregates and rondels along with other general improvements. In 1704 the walls of Narva were decimated and then demolished in 1777."

Eventually the Sultan realized that it was essential to have a garrison in Tripoli and that having a garrison in Hisn al-Akrad (Krak des Chevaliers) would not be enough to protect against an invasion. Under orders to fortify Tripoli, the governor of Tripoli then gutted the castle and used what he could to create a new citadel. In 1345 a second gate was added to the citadel by order of Sultan al-Kamil Sha’ban in an effort to more effectively tax land owners. This tax was unpopular and removed a few years later over the threat of revolt in Aleppo, Homs and Tripoli. In 1516 the citadel fell to the Ottomans and when Suleiman I took control over the Ottoman empire he ordered the citadel's reconstruction, the citadel was complete in 1521.

building_ub_doges_palace_02_desc:0 "Biblioteca Marciana is a library in Venice. It is one of the earliest surviving public libraries and repositories for manuscripts in Italy and holds one of the world's most significant collections of classical texts. It is named after St Mark, the patron saint of the city. \n\n The humanist scholar Cardinal Bessarion, bishop of Tusculum and titular Latin patriarch of Constantinople, donated his collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts to the Republic of Venice on the condition that a public library would be established. The Venetian government was slow, however, to honour its commitment to suitably house the manuscripts with decades of discussion and indecision, owing to a series of military conflicts in the late-fifteenth and early-sixteenth centuries and the resulting climate of political uncertainty. During the period of recovery as part of urban renewal project aimed at glorifying the republic through architecture and affirming its international prestige as a centre of wisdom and learning, The library was ultimately built by constructing a huge library in front of Doge's Palce and moving Bessarion's collection to library."

However this would not last long as an earthquake in 1157 would destroy much of al-Rahba and he would be forced to give it to Shirkuh. When Shirkuh died the citadel passed back to Nur ad-Din but Shirkuhs nephew, Saladin, believed it should be his. In 1182 Saladin conquered it from Nur ad-Din and then plowed through the rest of Nur ad-Din’s holdings such as Homs and Aleppo, then he would grant these to his cousin Nasir ad-Din Muhammad as a hereditary emir. The fortress was then rebuilt in 1207 by al-Mujahid Shirkuh, this would be known as the third construction. Qal’at al-Rahba would eventually be peacefully stolen by the Mamluks and then later torn to shreds by the Ottomans."

Later the bath complex was attached to the palace and barracks were added to the bath complex, this complicated its usage by the people of Trier."
