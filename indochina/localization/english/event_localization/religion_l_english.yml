I cannot believe that our mission failed, and that this foolish [mission_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] dared to ignore the truth of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName]. Was it because [mission_receiver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] soul was deceived by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]?

After what seemed like another year of interviews, my chancellor suggested that it might be a good idea to find an Iranian scribe instead.

Crazy how unpredictable back pains can be these days!"\n\nI take the papers given to me by [persian_expert_sassanid.GetName], and it looks like he did his homework. What I'm looking at is a well prepared family tree, written fully in Iranian, detailing my lineage and how it reaches all the way back to the Sassanid Emperors. My reading of Persian is a bit rusty, but I can make out my name, with my usual titles, but also with the additional title "Great Shah of Mount Qaf". Next to it is a poem:\n\n"In shadows deep, a secret son,\n\nOf Farrukhan, from Sassan's line,\n\nWith gold in hand, set out as one,\n\nTo rule a land where stars still shine.\n\nBeyond the mountains, mists, and storms,\n\nTo earth's far edge, he rode with pride,\n\nTo claim a throne in foreign forms,\n\nWhere ancient legends still abide."\n\nHe clears his throat.\n\n"We can spread this all around the Caucasus and even in Iran, if we so wish.

They were the great Shahs."\n\nWe did it.\n\nIt started with some rumours on the streets planted by [persian_expert_sassanid.GetName]'s agents. Then it spread in our lands like wildfire. Everyone in our country started talking about the deeds of my ancestors.\n\nIt was not long before I received word from Iran that my claims have also been presented there. Unlike here in our homeland, those in Iran were much more skeptical of it, with some outright mocking our claims or getting furious. Others did not even take it seriously. There were some who believed us, but certainly, they were a minority. But alas! Everyone knows I'm a great Iranian! Who cares what those Iranians think? My people are convinced!"
