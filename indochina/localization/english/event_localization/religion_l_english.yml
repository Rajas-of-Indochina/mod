There is always a chance that our missionaries will be unsuccessful, whether due to a lack of true faith and conviction, or because the unbelievers are too stubborn."

They also argued that I must abandon my blasphemous beliefs in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName], and, they added, lest I want to suffer the horrors of the afterlife in [mission_sender.GetFaith.NegativeAfterLife], I should convert as soon as possible to the one true faith: [mission_sender.GetFaith.GetName]."

I cannot believe that our mission failed, and that this foolish [mission_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] dared to ignore the truth of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName]. Was it because [mission_receiver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] soul was deceived by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]? Or was it because our missionaries were not true of heart, and therefore did not receive any divine aid from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"

I was informed that the fiendish [mission_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has executed all of my missionaies! What a sorrowful fate, that they would be murdered in cold blood merely for trying to spread the truth.

This will be more than a regular $d_khabzism$ where we talk about petty tribal conflicts or agricultural issues! Today, I will be crowned as the the Prince of Princes. Circassians will now be recognized in the world stage not as quarreling tribes, but as a single people under a single king.
