 religion.0001.desc:0 "To prove that I am a devout [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName], I intend to use the resources at my disposal to gather a number of faithful missionaries to spread the truth across the world. With my backing, and the protection of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], these brave souls will surely bring the light of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetNameNoTooltip] to foreign lands!\n\nThese missons require significant resources to ensure their success, but I must be careful when investing in this endeavor. There is always a chance that our missionaries will be unsuccessful, whether due to a lack of true faith and conviction, or because the unbelievers are too stubborn."

Unsurprisingly, they have demanded an audience with me, undoubtedly to convert me to their faith.\n\nAfter I granted these [mission_sender.GetFaith.GetAdjective] missionaries an audience, they began speaking of the glory of [mission_sender.GetFaith.HighGodName] and the truth of our cosmos as told in the [mission_sender.GetFaith.ReligiousText]. They also argued that I must abandon my blasphemous beliefs in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName], and, they added, lest I want to suffer the horrors of the afterlife in [mission_sender.GetFaith.NegativeAfterLife], I should convert as soon as possible to the one true faith: [mission_sender.GetFaith.GetName]."

Dejection and disappointment were written across their faces. They did not even need to say a word for me to know that their efforts were unsuccessful!\n\nDamnations! I cannot believe that our mission failed, and that this foolish [mission_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] dared to ignore the truth of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName]. Was it because [mission_receiver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] soul was deceived by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]? Or was it because our missionaries were not true of heart, and therefore did not receive any divine aid from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"

Our investment in these missionary's work has proven to be a resounding success, and there is no doubt that they were aided by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

I have not heard any news from them as of late, and I was worried that something misfortune may have befallen them. I even prayed to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to hope for their safety while they stayed in foreign lands.\n\nUnfortunately, I have finally received news today, and it is not good news. I was informed that the fiendish [mission_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has executed all of my missionaies! What a sorrowful fate, that they would be murdered in cold blood merely for trying to spread the truth. Perhaps this the doing of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName], trying to prevent us from spreading the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings"
