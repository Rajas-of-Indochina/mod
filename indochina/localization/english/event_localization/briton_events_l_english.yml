 briton.0001.t:0 "The Kingdom of Briton"
 briton.0001.desc:0 "This once small batch of immigrants from across the Oceanus Britannicus have in their small time away from Britannia established themselves as a unique cultural group. It was inevitable under these factors that one among the bunch would rise to kingship, on a wave of public appeal and praise or prehaps though political intrigue and unspeakable tyranny.\n\nEither way you have become the Rex Britonorum, the king of the Britons. All that remains now is the path for which you will lead your people, to a quick ruin or maybe to unspeakable glory."
 briton.0001.a:0 "All of Briton shall be free!"
 briton.0001.a_tt:0 "You gained the Kingdom of Briton and a new casus belli"
 
 briton.0002.desc:0 "After centuries of Roman control, one briton dares to end this and bring freedom to his people. After countless battles they succeeded in controlling enough land to be called King of Briton."
 briton.0002.a:0 "We must follow their actions closely"

 briton.0003.t:0 "Bending The Swords"
 briton.0003.desc:0 "As I stand victorious, standing tall like Celtic hero’s of old my enemy begs for mercy and clemency. for a quick moment I consider it but a lesson must be taught to our future would be foes and that lesson is dishonor and defeat await anyone who meets us on the field of battle.\n\nBefore my army I Put my enemies sword into a hot fire. Removing it from the smoldering fire I smash it’s edge onto the side of the anvil bending and distorting it in the process.\n\nThey came for victory but shall receive nothing but dishonor."
 briton.0003.a:0 "They shall suffer!"
 
 briton.0004.t:0 "Our Swords Bent"
 briton.0004.desc:0 "To bend the sword of a foe is akin to breaking their spirit. It is an old tradition as old as the Celts themselves. After our defeat, our enemy's thought it would be fitting to bend our swords and decommission a large portion of our armies"
 briton.0004.a:0 "We will get our revenge!"
 
 briton.0006.t:0 "The Briton Fracture"
 briton.0006.desc:0 "Over the long march of time cultures splinter, weather it be from foreign occupation from a external culture or simple and natural divergence. Whatever the case the Briton have forever fractured into three distinct and incompatible branches."

 briton.0007.t:0 "Migrating to Britannia"
 briton.0007.desc:0 "Many tribes head west across the Rhine and into Gallia in hopes of finding a new home in Roman territory. We instead venture across the North Sea, not to land in the overpopulated Gaul but to the untouched shores of Britannia. The island remains free of rivaling tribes landing upon her shores, which have been untouched by decades of looting and war. Most importantly, the situation on the mainland has forced the Roman government in Mediolanum to focus on the defense of the Rhine and the Danube, leaving Britannia largely vulnerable and undefended. As Roman dominion over Britannia shrivels into ash by the day, what is a better time for us to carve out a new homeland along the white cliffs, within the dense forests, and among the temples and palaces of Camulodunum and Londinium?"
 briton.0007.option.a:0 "We shall build a new homeland upon the ashes of Roman Britain!"
 briton.0007.option.a.tooltip:0 "You ignite the invasion of Britannia, starting a migration war"
 briton.0007.option.b:0 "Nevermind, the risk is far too great"

 briton.0008.t:0 "A Rightful King"
 briton.0008.desc:0 "In 43 CE, Emperor Claudius commenced the Roman conquest of Britannia, eventually bringing most of the island under imperial control by 84 CE. With Britannia largely defenseless, those who continue inhabiting and governing the land now find themselves leading a vulnerable province that may soon transform into a chaotic battleground.\n\n With the incompetent court in Mediolanum, it is evident that the protection of Britannia is the least of their concerns; in complete contrast to myself. I now implore those who are faithful to the dignity of the Roman Empire to flock to my banners and ensure Britannia's security in this time of uncertainty!"
 briton.0008.a:0 "We strike now!"
 briton.0008.a_tt:0 "You start a war with the emperor to claim the province of britannia, vassals might join."

 briton.0009.t:0 "A Usurper"
 briton.0009.desc:0 "In 43 CE, Emperor Claudius commenced the Roman conquest of Britannia, eventually bringing most of the island under imperial control by 84 CE. With Britannia largely defenseless, those who continue inhabiting and governing the land now find themselves leading a vulnerable province that may soon transform into a chaotic battleground.\n\n [attacker.GetName] has sent this message to all officials in the province of Britannia requesting help in his war to establish a base of operations, leading to concerns that he will not stop with the island . . ."
 briton.0009.a:0 "You have my sword!"
 briton.0009.b:0 "A worthless claim!"

 briton.0010.t:0 "A Usurper"
 briton.0010.desc:0 "[attacker.GetName] has laid a claim on the province of Britannia! Gaining much traction and support among the province's officials, this illegitimate claim poses a serious danger to the Western Roman Empire's stability! We cannot allow another repeat of the Crisis of the Third Century, or our inept response will surely plunge the empire into a civil war!"
 briton.0010.a:0 "Muster the legions!"
