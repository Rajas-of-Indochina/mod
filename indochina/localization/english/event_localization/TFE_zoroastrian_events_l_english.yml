TFE_zoroastrian.0001.desc:0 "Rumours have made my court that a man that goes by the name of #italic Mazdak #! has reached an impressive amount of following over the last few days. Of Persian stock, he was blessed with the task of reciting the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText]. While a bright man of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], he has taken it upon himself to reinterpret the old teachings of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] and is now preaching in $b_baghdad$ a fresh take on them. \n\nAcording to #italic Mazdak #!, we should express our faith in brotherly love and in making sure all men and women are treated iqually and with respect!"
