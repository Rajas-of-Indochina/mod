# Events 


disaster.0010.t:0 "The Dust Veil"
 disaster.0010.desc:0 "During this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness, like the moon, during this whole year, and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear nor such as it is accustomed to shed. And from the time, when this thing happened, men were neither free from war nor pestilence nor any other thing leading to death."
 disaster.0010.a:0 "A divine sign!"
 disaster.0010.b:0 "A bothersome omen at best"
disaster.0011.t:0 "Earthquake in Latium"
 # Descritpion by Sethos
 disaster.0011.desc:0 "Today in the middle of the night, the earth herself trembled. The aftermath was anything short of devastating. Reports of houses collapsing on unsuspecting families and fires breaking out throughout the lands of Latium have come piling in. Homes, marketplaces, places of worship and trees that were once sturdy and proud are now in complete ruin. Even the walls of the great Colosseum in Rome has not gone unscathed... This desolation has left countless wounded, homeless or dead." 
 disaster.0011.a:0 "What would Titus do..."
disaster.0012.t:0 "Crop Misrotation"
 disaster.0012.desc:0 "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]! News from the countryside has arrived. After years of pristine high yield, poor laborers from Latium apparently lost all output. According to their missive, an outbreak of fever decimated the population, after floods inflicted heavy damages on the fields. Our steward suspects that their cupidity lead them to skip fallow rotation. There simply is nobody, and nowhere, to work anymore; everything is ruined."
 disaster.0012.a:0 "Greed is a sin. Their downfall does not concern us."
 disaster.0012.b:0 "We should send relief aid rightaway!"
