 ruler_popups.0001.desc:0 "King U Shiei Lung finds himself at a crossroads. After succeeding his father at the age of 15, he launched a campaign against Tang China, seizing control of Annam. After years of mustering forces, Tang sent the highly accomplished general, Gao Pian, to take it back, finally succeeding in 866, merely a year ago. He has reestablished Annam as Jinghai Jun, fortifying it against any future invasion.\n\nPrior to this, Nan Chao had sent Burmese horse raiders east into the Irrawaddy Valley, defeating the Pyu city-states that once dominated the region. Those lands now lie ripe for the picking, and the lord of Pagan may be a useful ally if you choose to seize them for yourself, or perhaps even the divided tribes to the south.\n\nAt home, the recent influx of Buddhist monks from India has presented a unique opportunity. Until now, Nan Chao has been a decentralized hierarchy of clans and tribes. However, these new Buddhist ways of thinking, along with the bureaucratic ideas of Tang, may be the road to consolidating your hold over the tribes. With some time, it may be possible to cast aside the ways of old and enforce your absolute rule over all of Nan Chao.\n\nMany paths lie open for you, U Shiei Lung. Which will you take?"
