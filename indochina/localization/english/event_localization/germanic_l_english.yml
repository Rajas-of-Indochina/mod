 germanic_events.0003.t:0 "The Frankish Invasion"
 germanic_events.0003.desc:0 "For centuries, the Romans had greedily kept the fertile lands of Gaul under their control, and it was only through Roman weakness in which we were allowed to settle the province's northern frontiers as the empire's foederati. The Western Roman Empire had recently collapsed, and the last remaining vestiges of Roman authority in the west lies in the Domain of Soissons\n\n The rule over Soissons is already a fragile one, with the domain beset on all sides by forces hostile to a Roman-governed polity. As we were the first of the Germanic tribes to settle in Gaul, our claim over the region is strongest and it is time to lay Roman rule to rest in Western Europe."

 germanic_events.0005.desc:0 "As we settle in our new and fertile lands, we must secure our borders from all sides and that especially includes the northren border and the newly conquered francia. The new frankish kingdom north will probably not be satisfied with their part of gaul and pushing downwards is a real possibility.

The self-proclaimed King of Italy had violated his duty as a client ruler when he marched against the Emperor, and now we are summoned to take away the Italian crown for ourselves. \n\nDominion over the former Roman heartland will grant us more prestige and power than the other Germanic successor states, but undertaking such an invasion on behalf of Constantinople will be looked down upon by the Ostrogothic Kingdom's subjects."

This time, however, [italy_holder_dissent.GetSheHe] has gone beyond his limits! My loyal vicars have come to me with detrimental news, [italy_holder_dissent.GetName] has sent his followers to sow dissent in our empire!\n\n This is a clear message of treason and should be handled as such! If we don't react now, we don't know what else [italy_holder_dissent.GetSheHe] will try."
