 feudalization.0003.desc:0 "After the empire lost it's control over our lands, we have slowly drifted away from their traditions and doctrines. Without the huge imperial treasury loyalty of our subjects is no longer easily formed and we started granting fiefs to our subjects in return for their loyalty and tribute. Truly, we have strayed far from the days of old and can no longer truly call our realm roman."
