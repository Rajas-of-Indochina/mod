 mandala_government_desc:0 "\n#F The Mandala System is used as a way to organize a state as a circle, or mandala, around a central metropolis. In this way the political and geographic realities can shape the level of direct control from the center. From subject states in the periphery to the more directly controlled sub cities closer to the center. #!"

 anarchist_government_desc:0 "A stateless society lacks the formal hierarchies of other forms of governance. Each "ruler" is a representative of their lands whose actions are held to account by the people. Succession within a commune is elective, with each representative having a say. If a single family can maintain power for long enough, they may be able to reform to Tribal."
