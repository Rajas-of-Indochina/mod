  tradition_underground_cities_desc:0 "This culture has carved out vast, interconnected caverns in the mountains of Cappadocia for centuries. These caverns are so vast that they are in truth more like underground cities. Highly defensible, they are often filled with booby traps and other terrifying surprises awaiting any armies foolish enough to attack them."
