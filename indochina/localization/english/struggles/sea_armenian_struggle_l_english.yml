 armenian_struggle_ending_phase_foreign_rule:0 "Foreign Rule"
 armenian_struggle_ending_phase_foreign_rule_desc:0 "While Persians, Romans and Armenians make plays to rule the southern Caucasus, the world still turns around them. Should an interloper seize and hold control over Armenia, then the struggle may come to an anticlimactic end."
