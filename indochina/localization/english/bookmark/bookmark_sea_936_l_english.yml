Shi so impressed Li Siyuan that he was offered Li's daughter in marriage, tying him to the future emperors.\n\nBy 936, Li Siyuan's adopted son Li Congke had become the Emperor of the Later Tang, and despite their familial bond general Shi and Emperor Li had grown distrustful and fearful of one another. After a number of exchanges Emperor Li decided to have Shi stripped of his titles and ordered his sons and brother killed. Shi sent for aid from the Khitan Khagan Yarüd Ñaugu, promising the Sixteen Prefectures if they would support him as Emperor.\n\n#bold The stage is set, and the combined armies of Shi and Khitan march against the Later Tang. Will you lead them to victory against your vengeful brother-in-law or is this revolt doomed to failure?#!"
