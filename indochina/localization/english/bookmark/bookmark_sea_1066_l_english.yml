What was formerly but a large city-state was now the mightiest polity yet seen in the Irrawaddy Valley, and the second-largest empire in Mainland Southeast Asia - behind only the neighboring Khmers. A convert from Ari to Theravada Buddhism, Anawrahta also built many pagodas across the empire, allowing for a flourishing of the religion otherwise in decline in both Southeast Asia and India.\n\n#bold Anawrahta's reign marks the beginning of a great empire, but such successes create many enemies.
