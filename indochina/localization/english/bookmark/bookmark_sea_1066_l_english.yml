But near the end of his life he split the kingdom in two, Panjalu and Janggala, to stop the quarreling between his sons.\n\n#bold Will you respect his wishes or will you reunite Java once more? #!"

But she secluded herself to be a Bhikkuni, putting the next eldest, Samarawijaya, as the next heir to the throne.

  bm_1066_sea_china_desc:0 "The Song dynasty emerged in the year 960 out of the chaos left by the collapse of the Tang, managing to reunite most of the empire by 979, though with the loss of some territories to the Xia, Liao, and Dai Viet, the most significant of which were the Sixteen Prefectures taken by the Khitans. Much back-and-forth fighting continued until the signing of the Chanyuan Treaty, which had the Song provide a yearly tribute to the Liao, as well as recognition as diplomatic equals. With this peace secured, the two empires are now free to deal with other matters.\n\n#bold Two Sons of Heaven now reign in the East.

The Han and Khitan populations both seek greater influence within government, and finding the proper balance will be Emperor Hongji's greatest challenge.\n\n#bold Can you maintain internal peace within Liao, or will the diverse factions rip the empire apart? #!"

Cordial relations are maintained with Pagan to the east despite their expansionism, while those with Dai Viet, though marred by a few incidents along the border, are generally peaceful.\n\n#bold Dali is currently enjoying a period of peace and prosperity.

What was formerly but a large city-state was now the mightiest polity yet seen in the Irrawaddy Valley, and the second-largest empire in Mainland Southeast Asia - behind only the neighboring Khmers. A convert from Ari to Theravada Buddhism, Anawrahta also built many pagodas across the empire, allowing for a flourishing of the religion otherwise in decline in both Southeast Asia and India.\n\n#bold Anawrahta's reign marks the beginning of a great empire, but such successes create many enemies.

After William's conquest, those unwilling to kneel fled east, becoming mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire. It was Emperor Alexios who spoke of a distant land, Zichia, once touched by Constantinople’s reach, now ruled by scattered, semi-Christian tribes. So they sailed beyond the edge of Christendom, axes in hand, and carved a kingdom from the wild shores and named it New England.\n\n#bold Will he forge a future for his people in this strange land, or attempt to return and reclaim England?#!"

Indeed, decades later, when the Mongol horde descends upon the Caucasus, they would be met by Grand Prince Tuqar, no longer a boy, but a wise elder, who stands at the head of not only Zichia, but all Circassians. And he would not be alone - he would make many friends all across the Caucasus, including the Chechen Prince Khour, ruler of the Durdzuk, ready to die alongside him to defend the Caucasus mountains. He would fall in battle, but not before leading his people into the mountains for guerilla warfare.\n\n#bold Will Tuqar rise to become the leader Circassia needs, or will the dream of unity die with him? #!"

His grandfather Ildeguz was a Kipchak military slave who rose to become a Seljuk atabeg (governor). Under Muhammed's rule, the Ildeguzid Atabegate became more than a mere atabegate, expanding its reach in every direction. He oversaw the construction of grand mosques, supported scholars and poets, and turned his court into a center of culture and learning. On paper, he is merely a governor of the Seljuks, but he has grown so strong that in practice, it is the Seljuks who bow to him.

Now serving under the Alanised Bagrationi Exousiokrator, Vladislav remains loyal, at least on the surface. There are bold rumors, however, some say he dreams of restoring his family's claim and becoming Exousiokrator himself.\n\n#bold Will Vladislav remain a loyal servant, or rise to reclaim Alania in the name of the old blood? #!"
