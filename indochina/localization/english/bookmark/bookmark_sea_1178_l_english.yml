  bm_1178_sea_caucasus:0 "A Storm from the Northeast"
  bm_1178_sea_caucasus_desc:0 "The Caucasus remains divided, now in a period of independence from foreign rulers that ranges from nominal to undeniable, with an ascendant Georgia as a strong but not sole contender for the hegemony over the region south of the mountains. Meanwhile, a brewing power struggle keeps Persia divided against itself, and dynastic struggles in Constantinople and Seljuk dominance in Anatolia have left the Romans crippled and unable to project power into the region.\n\nWhile the $armenian_struggle$ remains ongoing, another, smaller but no less consequential struggle  out as the tribes north of the Caucasus Mountains attempt to unify.\n\nBut they must all make haste, because a wind is blowing in from the Steppe, one that hopes to blow down everything that the peoples of the Caucasus are trying to build.\n\n#Bold Will you fall to the thundering of hooves and the clash of blades, or will you rewrite history and stand tall against the invaders yet to come?#!"

  bookmark_caucasus_new_england_desc:0 "Rædwulf is more than a mere earl, he is the grandson of Siward Barn, the English thegn who defied the Normans during the fall of England. After William's conquest, those unwilling to kneel fled east, becoming mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire. It was Emperor Alexios who spoke of a distant land, Zichia, once touched by Constantinople’s reach, now ruled by scattered, semi-Christian tribes. So they sailed beyond the edge of Christendom, axes in hand, and carved a kingdom from the wild shores and named it New England.\n\n#bold Will he forge a future for his people in this strange land, or attempt to return and reclaim England?#!"
  bookmark_caucasus_tuqar_of_zichia:0 "Grand Prince Tuqar"
  bookmark_caucasus_tuqar_of_zichia_desc:0 "Zichia stands without a Grand Prince in 1178, but many believe that young Tuqar, a noble boy of exceptional promise, is the obvious candidate for the future. Indeed, decades later, when the Mongol horde descends upon the Caucasus, they would be met by Grand Prince Tuqar, no longer a boy, but a wise elder, who stands at the head of not only Zichia, but all Circassians. And he would not be alone - he would make many friends all across the Caucasus, including the Chechen Prince Khour, ruler of the Durdzuk, ready to die alongside him to defend the Caucasus mountains. He would fall in battle, but not before leading his people into the mountains for guerilla warfare.\n\n#bold Will Tuqar rise to become the leader Circassia needs, or will the dream of unity die with him? #!"
  bookmark_caucasus_jahan_pahlavan:0 "Atabeg-e Azam Muhammed Jahan Pahlavan"
  bookmark_caucasus_jahan_pahlavan_desc:0 "Muhammed, better known by his title Jahan Pahlavan, “Hero of the World”, was the true architect of the Ildeguzid golden age. His grandfather Ildeguz was a Kipchak military slave who rose to become a Seljuk atabeg (governor). Under Muhammed's rule, the Ildeguzid Atabegate became more than a mere atabegate, expanding its reach in every direction. He oversaw the construction of grand mosques, supported scholars and poets, and turned his court into a center of culture and learning. On paper, he is merely a governor of the Seljuks, but he has grown so strong that in practice, it is the Seljuks who bow to him. Both sides keep up the charade for now.\n\n#bold Will Jahan Pahlavan continue to rule from the shadows, or claim his rightful place as a sovereign in his own right? #!"

  bookmark_caucasus_vladislav_suarny_desc:0 "Vladislav traces his lineage to the once-great Tsarazon dynasty, rulers of Alania before the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty seized the throne through marriage and politics. While the Alan branch of the Bagrationi have since adopted the Alan name and customs, Vladislav misses the good old days when real Alans ruled Alania, not latecomers wrapped in borrowed traditions. Now serving under the Alanised Bagrationi Exousiokrator, Vladislav remains loyal, at least on the surface. There are bold rumors, however, some say he dreams of restoring his family's claim and becoming Exousiokrator himself.\n\n#bold Will Vladislav remain a loyal servant, or rise to reclaim Alania in the name of the old blood? #!"

  bookmark_caucasus_khour_of_ogra_desc:0 "Khour, son of Ela Khasi, stands as the heir to the highland realm of the Durdzuks. A young leader of the Orga and scion of the grand Sado-Orsoy clan, his lineage is said to stretch back to mythical Narts. Though his title may seem humble for now, fate has greater plans. Decades from now, when the Mongols thunder through the passes of the Caucasus, Khour will not stand alone. He will rally his people, forge bonds with Alans, Lezgins, and Circassians, and march under one banner beside Grand Prince Tuqar of Zichia.\n\n#bold Will you rise from the mountains and stand as a defender of the Caucasus—or be swept aside like so many before? #!""
