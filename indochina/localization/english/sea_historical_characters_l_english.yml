 historical_character.ken_arok: "Ken Arok's origin is shrouded in mystery. Legends say that he was the son of a peasant Brahmin, while others speculate that he was the bastard of Sri Jayamerta, Raja of Janggala. What is known, however, is that he was raised by bandits and become one of the most fearsome criminals in Java. He would later serve as the servant of Tunggul Ametung, a local lord, before assassinating him, taking over his throne, and carving out a kingdom of his own as the first king of the Rajasa dynasty. His reign and subsequent succession would be marred with murders and betrayals, but his descendants would later rule over Java and Nusantara as the Maharajas of Majapahit."
