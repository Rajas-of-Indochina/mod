 trait_chakobsa:0 "Chakobsa speaker"
 trait_chakobsa_desc:1 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can speak Chakobsa, a secret Circassian language spoken by very few people, first crafted by nobles for hunting, seeking to emulate the Narts' language as a tribute to the forest deities' sovereignty. The vocabulary is based on imitating the sounds of nature. It is now used primarily by hunters wishing to get on good terms with the god of hunting, as well as spies trying to conceal their secret messages."

 trait_farschipse:0 "Farschipse speaker"
 trait_farschipse_desc:1 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and his closest men spent a considerable amount of time practising to utilise Farschipse, a military code based on the Circassian language. Sentences are encrypted by a constantly changing system of reordering words, changing phonemes, removing certain letters and adding meaningless suffixes and prefixes. While an educated person can decyrpt it in a few days, it is impossible to do so in the heat of battle, and thus it is an ideal tool for communication during warfare."

 trait_sikowschir_desc:1 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been taught Sikowschir, a man-made, royal version of the Circassian language, spoken only by the most elite of Circassian nobles. It shares Circassian grammar, but not vocabulary, making it impossible to understand for speakers of common Circassian. Not everyone is allowed to learn Sikowschir, and it is certainly a great source of prestige to know it."
