 alevi.0003.desc:0 ""[prophet_muhammad_roa.GetName] was the Yalavaç of Tengri.", the man says, "Tengri Ta'ala chose him to guide mankind to love and truth."\n\nThese are the words of a popular sage among the Turks, spreading from ear to ear like wildfire.\n\nAs Turkic hordes conquered and settled in new lands, they brought Islam with them. But even after Islamisation, those migratory tribes did not simply abandon their old way of life, but merged it with a new set of beliefs, one sage among them stands out - [new_alevi.GetName], also known as "Haji Bektash Veli".\n\nThis charismatic wandering mystic has systemised these beliefs and already garnered many followers over the years, word has it that many previously non-Muslim Turks are converting to Islam in flocks. He himself claims to preach nothing new, and states again and again that he is drawing his teachings from past Muslim scholars like [ahmad_yasawi_roa.GetName], [aslanbab.GetName], and [persian_scholars_3.GetName] though his opponents claim his words sometimes contradict orthodox Islam.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for the region?"

 alevi.0004.desc:0 "A servant walks up to me, informing me that the Muslim envoy we called for has finally arrived. I order him to be brought before me. The man arrives, looking around, and then at me. Dressed in fancy foreign robes, he carries an air of wisdom and purpose, carrying himself with the authority of one who serves a mighty ruler and a powerful faith. I signal him to speak, and he eagerly begins, silently muttering [Glossary( 'something in Arabic', 'BASMALA_BOLGHAR_GLOSS' )] before switching to our language. \n\n"Peace be upon you, my lord" he says, "My name is [muslim_bolghar_envoy.GetName] and I bring you gifts and greetings and an invitation to understand our ways."\n\nHe hands the servants some papers, and they bring it to me.\n\n"I have brought with me parts of the Qur'an, our holy texts, translated into a Turkic dialect - which I thought might be more familiar to you than Arabic.\n\n"If you wish, I can share more about the faith, so you may judge for yourself whether it has a place in your realm.""
 alevi.0004.a:0 "Tell me about this Islam of yours."

 BASMALA_BOLGHAR_GLOSS: "The #bold "Basmala"#! is the phrase "Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim," meaning "In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful." It opens almost every chapter of the Qur'an and is a reminder to begin actions with mindfulness of God’s mercy and guidance. Muslims recite it before any task."

What he is saying is good, but it's a big risk to switch religions...\n\n"Sir?""

For leaders, this unity means people who would fight with renewed purpose, believing they carry out a higher will. With Islam, tribes and families across lands distant and near have united as brothers. These men fight as one, serve as one, and respect the authority of their rulers under the banner of faith."\n\nHe pauses, then adds, "By embracing Islam, you could gather warriors who are not only loyal but also deeply committed. And you'd be part of the [Glossary( 'Ummah', 'UMMAH_BOLGHAR_GLOSS' )] - becoming like siblings with all Muslim rulers. Not to mention all the trade benefits...""

 SHAHADA_BOLGHAR_GLOSS: "The #bold "Shahada"#! is the Islamic declaration of faith, stating, "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." It is the first pillar of Islam and expresses the core belief in the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. Reciting the shahada with sincere conviction is essential to becoming a Muslim."

 alevi.0009.desc:0 "There are words of a faith spreading across many lands, which they call "Islam", drawing people from many walks of life, even some of our fellow Turks. Their influence is growing, shaping politics, strengthening armies, and advancing knowledge in arts and sciences. Perhaps, by embracing this faith, we too could share in its power. By inviting an envoy from a mighty Muslim ruler, we may learn how to join them and welcome Islam into our realm. And who knows, maybe they have some good points after all? Now that we are independent, this could be of use to us."
