My people are convinced!\n\nAlthough if I embraced their faith, maybe the Iranians would look more positively on my claims?\n\nOn one hand is Islam, which is rising in Persia, as well as right here in the Caucasus. Besides helping with my claims it night help me forge allianes with my neighbours.\n\nOn the other hand is Zoroastrianism, the original religion of the Sassanid Emperors.

 ROAintro.001_desc:0 "Thank you for playing with Rajas of Asia!\n\nYou have chosen to play as the Circassians, a people forged by the rugged peaks and verdant valleys of the North Caucasus. For centuries, the Circassians have thrived as a fiercely independent and valorous people, bound by their unwavering adherence to the [Glossary( 'Xabze', 'XABZE_GLOSS' )], the ancient code of honor and law that governs their lives.\n\nCircassia is a realm of endless mountains, shadowed forests, and deep river valleys, a land as harsh as it is beautiful. For generations, these natural defenses have shielded the Circassians against relentless invaders: Cimmerians, Scythians, Greeks, Alans, Huns, Göktürks, Avars, Khazars, and many more have marched upon this land, seeking to claim it for their own. Each time, the Circassians resisted, refusing to bow to any conqueror.\n\nUnlike their Abkhazian cousins, Circassians do not have central leadership. For as long as anyone can remember, there has been a Grand Prince of Circassia, a title bestowed upon the most respected and powerful leader, often from the Principality of [GetTitleByKey('d_zichia').GetNameNoTier]. In name, this grand prince is the ruler of all Circassians, the king of kings among the clans. In reality, it is but a hollow formality, rarely taken seriously by the fiercely independent princes. Should you ask a Circassian prince, "To which kingdom do you belong?" he would likely laugh, look around, and answer, "Why, mine, of course!" Press further, asking who reigns above him, and he would simply reply, "#italic God and no one else!#!" Such is the spirit of this land - unyielding, proud, and untamed.\n\nNow, you step into this land of splintered clans and untamed kings. Will you forge unity from discord, or will you embrace the fierce independence that defines these people? The future of Circassia rests in your hands."

This wild and unforgiving landscape shapes the Durdzuks, fostering a people as resilient and unyielding as the peaks they call home.\n\nFor as long as memory stretches, invaders have tested the Durdzuks’ resolve—Scythians, Alans, Khazars, and countless others have sought to subjugate their land. Yet the Durdzuks endure, holding fast to their ancestral villages and fortified mountain strongholds. Holding tightly to their [Glossary( 'Nokhchalla', 'ADAT_GLOSS' )], their motto is simple and fierce: "We are wolves to our enemies, but brothers to those we trust."\n\nThe Durdzuks’ society revolves around the clan (teip), an extended family that forms the foundation of their identity and governance. Each teip is fiercely autonomous, and while they may unite against common threats, no single ruler commands the entirety of the Durdzuks: though there is an elected leader, most Durdzuks would answer to no one but their own elders and God above."

The influence of Georgia to the east has grown strong, and many among the Abkhaz nobility have adopted Georgian ways - speaking its tongue, following its customs, and swearing loyalty to its kings. Yet in the mountain valleys and hidden hamlets, the old ways endure. Here, the Abkhaz tongue is spoken without foreign influence, the traditions of their ancestors are upheld, and in some remote places, even the ancient gods are still honored in secret.\n\nBound by [Glossary( 'Akabza', 'XABZE_GLOSS' )], the unwritten code of honor and conduct, the Abkhaz uphold values of hospitality, bravery, and loyalty. These customs, passed down through generations, shape their society just as much as any king or noble decree. Though entwined with their neighbors, the Abkhazians share deep kinship with the Circassians to the north, their distant cousins who dwell in the highlands and along the shores of the Black Sea.\n\nThe fate of Abkhazia is uncertain. Will its people remain distinct, carving their own path between the empires that rise and fall around them? Or will the pull of greater kingdoms draw them ever deeper into their orbit, changing them forever? That choice is now yours to make."
