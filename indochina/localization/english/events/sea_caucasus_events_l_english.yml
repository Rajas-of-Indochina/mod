 caucasianroa.001_desc:0 "We have sent some of our best men to distant Christian lands in order to bring us up to speed with the current state of the Christian world, and they brought with them some merchants and theologians who volunteered to help us with the process of Christianization. We're already acquainted with the Churches in Rome and Constantinople. Additionally, there are others telling us about other churches."

 caucasianroa.002_desc:0 "It has been a while since I approved of a plan to seek further cooperation with Armenians. In the afternoon, my steward approached me and informed me of the success of my plan regarding Armenian trade. It seems my efforts haven't gone unnoticed; numerous merchants and artisans, whether driven by profit or adventure, are flocking to my lands, which is already making me a profit. Additionally, the Armenian leader has reached out to me, expressing optimism for our future cooperation."

Utter nonsense!" my [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] [chaplain.GetFirstName] interjects. "This is heresy! They deny [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName]!

 caucasianroa.004_desc:0 "I gesture for the infidels to speak their piece.\n\nThe infidel who stepped forward takes a deep breath and whispers something to himself before beginning.\n\n"My lord, we are not here to bring hostility to your realm. In a way, we too worship [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName]. But we believe that only [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName] is to be praised. If you allow us to live in your country without fear, we would be grateful. And maybe our trade contacts in Sham and Baghdad would also appreciate this..."\n\n"Plus, I doubt your beliefs teach you to be cruel towards your own subjets?" He gulps and awaits my reaction."
 caucasianroa.004.a:0 "Very well, you can continue living and preaching in my realm!"

Every important person in Circassia is here - nobles, warriors, clergy, great $trait_thamade$s from all over the country, and even some old foes are arriving to hold the greatest $d_circassian_pagan$ council in our history where they will pledge their loyalty to me. This will be more than a regular $d_circassian_pagan$ where we talk about petty tribal conflicts or agricultural issues! Today, I will be crowned as the the Prince of Princes. Circassians will now be recognized in the world stage not as quarreling tribes, but as a single people under a single king.

They call their unifier-king the Āǩəbəug, that is, "Ak Yabgu", a title the Circassians borrowed from Turkic languages, meaning "The White Ruler". This term might be chosen as a direct challenge to the rule of the Turkic tribes in the north. After centuries of never ending infighting, these people have gotten way too used to war, let's hope they will not be directing their military prowess against the outside world..."

 caucasianroa.008.t:0 "Lost sons of Bahram: The Search"
 caucasianroa.008.desc:0 "In order to prove our Sassanid lineage, we need to make sure that we are relying on the correct sources, and not charlatans. After all, who would like to falsify history for their own benefit? That is why during the last month every great storyteller in our realm has been summoned and interviewed, but none proved to be good enough. After what seemed like another year of interviews, my chancellor suggested that it might be a good idea to find an Iranian scribe instead. After all, the Sassanids, my true ancestors, were Iranian!"

It doesn't seem like even he believes his own words.\n\n"Anyway, I think I faintly remember in our ancient wisdom something along the lines of a descendant of Sassan going to Mount Qaf, that is, Elbrus and the Caucasus... But I really need to refresh my memory on that."\n\nHe finishes, taking a breath. "If only there was a way to do that...""

Yes, yes, this was one of the first secret histories I memorised in fact, totally..."\n\nHe looks around and at the ceiling before continuing.\n\n"I'm sure I have some records of this somewhere, I would reach for it, if only my back would stop hurting...""

Crazy how unpredictable back pains can be these days!"\n\nI take the papers given to me by [persian_expert_sassanid.GetName]. What I'm looking at is a well fabri-, uh, well prepared family tree, written fully in Persian, detailing my lineage and how it reaches all the way back to the Sassanid Emperors. My reading of Persian is a bit rusty, but I can make out my name, with my usual titles, but also with the additional title "Great Shah of Mount Qaf". Next to it is a poem:\n\n"In shadows deep, a secret son,\n\nOf Farrukhan, from Sassan's line,\n\nWith gold in hand, set out as one,\n\nTo rule a land where stars still shine.\n\nBeyond the mountains, mists, and storms,\n\nTo earth's far edge, he rode with pride,\n\nTo claim a throne in foreign forms,\n\nWhere ancient legends still abide."\n\nHe clears his throat.\n\n"We can spread this all around the region around Mount Qaf and even in Iran, if we so wish. I know a great deal of influential people, my lord. I'm sure I could contact them to spread the word," he says, before pausing for a second, "if only my hand didn't hurt, so I could write some letters...""

Consider this matter done, my lord. I will send word to my associates around Iran, as well as some merchantile friends of mine who operate in this region. Now if I was greedy and did my work for the sake of worldly gains, I would shamelessly ask you for compenstation for my work.

Everyone in our country started talking about the deeds of my ancestors.\n\nIt was not long before I received word from Iran that my claims have also been presented there. Unlike here in our homeland, those in Iran were much more skeptical of it, with some outright mocking our claims or getting furious. Others did not even take it seriously. There were some who believed us, but certainly, they were a minority. But alas! Everyone knows I'm a great Iranian! Who cares what those Iranians think? My people are convinced!\n\nAlthough if I embraced their faith, maybe the Iranians would look more positively on my claims?\n\nOn one hand is Islam, which is rising in Persia, as well as right here in the Caucasus. Besides helping with my claims it night help me forge allianes with my neighbours.\n\nOn the other hand is Zoroastrianism, the original religion of the Sassanid Emperors. We can find some holy texts and invite surviving Zoroastrian clergy to teach us the religion so we can truly become one with our ancestors."
