Minus a sudden upturn of exorbitant spending that might accompany a new war or a natural disaster we should continue on this stable trend for the foreseeable future."

This is because the economy as its stands is on a slow downturn that can fortunately still be reversed before it reaches disastrous levels. Some projects will have to be halted for the time being or we could be looking at a recession in a year or two. I must use what remains in the treasury to turn this around."
